## Schema

### Read-Only

- `content_type` (String) The content type of the image. Example value: "image/png"

- `inline` (Boolean) If true, the attachment is excluded from the attachment list and the attachment's URL can be referenced within the comment of a ticket. Default is false.
- `size` (Number) The size of the image file in bytes.
- `thumbnails` (Set of Object) A list of attachments. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--thumbnails))
- `token` (String) The token of the uploaded attachment.

<a id="nestedatt--thumbnails"></a>
